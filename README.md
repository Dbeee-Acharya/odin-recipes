# odin-recipies
The odin project HTML website assignment, I am very confused on how to use git properly right now but i hope making this website gives me more knowledge on git and github.

The website is complete as far as i can see and im glad to say that i understand how to use git (add, commit and push) so much better. Though its not pretty and could use cleaner writing, im proud of this website.

I Tried to make this website as cringe as I could and i think ive succeeded!!
