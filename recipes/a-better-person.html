            Life sometimes feels like a messed up recipe, a recipe that has turned out to be a disaster.
            Everyone's recipe of life is different. Sometimes you are soaring higher than clouds and sometimes
            you feel so low that you loose the courage to keep fighting. We all have been through shit, we all know 
            that life is not always easy but what we all should know is that giving up and letting go is never the answer.
            Lets make a recipe, a recipe that will make you a better version of <em>yourself!</em>
